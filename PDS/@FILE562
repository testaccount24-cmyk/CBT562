//***FILE 562 is from Dick Thornton, who is the author of the       *   FILE 562
//*           DISASSEMBLER program on File 217, and his new         *   FILE 562
//*           DISASSEMBLER program on File 234.  This is his EXEC   *   FILE 562
//*           library which also contains an ISPF panel library     *   FILE 562
//*           (as member $PNLS) and an ISPF message library (as     *   FILE 562
//*           member $MSGS).  Member $$PDSLOD is a job to create    *   FILE 562
//*           pds'es from the $MSGS and $PNLS members of this file. *   FILE 562

//*      I am including three XMIT files in this package.           *   FILE 562
//*                                                                 *   FILE 562
//*      They are EXEC, MSGS, and PLIB which together contain an    *   FILE 562
//*      ISPF dialog I wrote in an attempt to give our              *   FILE 562
//*      programmers an online guide to reading Abend-Aid dumps.    *   FILE 562
//*      It is intended to provide instructions a programmer can    *   FILE 562
//*      use to analyze a SYSUDUMP produced by Abend-Aid in order   *   FILE 562
//*      to locate the abending instruction and the corresponding   *   FILE 562
//*      instruction in their COBOL source program.  In addition,   *   FILE 562
//*      it aids in location of selected data fields in the dump.   *   FILE 562
//*      It isn't used extensively here, as I didn't follow up      *   FILE 562
//*      and issue training and advertising about it.               *   FILE 562
//*                                                                 *   FILE 562
