This note talks about the purpose of the EXECs in this file,
together with the supporting Panel and Message Libraries:

I am going to try to send three small XMIT files with this email
to see if they go ok, and if you can read them successfully.  They
are EXEC, MSGS, and PLIB which together contain an ISPF dialog I
wrote in an attempt to give our programmers an online guide to
reading Abend-Aid dumps.  It is intended to provide instructions a
programmer can use to analyze a SYSUDUMP produced by Abend-Aid in
order to locate the abending instruction and the corresponding
instruction in their COBOL source program.  In addition, it aids
in location of selected data fields in the dump.  It isn't used
extensively here, as I didn't follow up and issue training and
advertising about it.
