Hi Sam,

This morning I have a $$README file to be added to FILE562. It
contains documentation for the members in the has file (REXX
EXEC's) as well as for the members in the included MSGS and PLIB
files. This file is a direct download from the mainframe to the
PC using binary and no CR/LF. It was not XMITed. My intent (if it
is a usable file) is for it to be added to FILE562 as member
$$README.

As usual, I have a list of deleted elements, though short this
time. I have deleted as trash these members from the PLIB file:
#CUT, #CUTD, #PASD, #PASTE, C1SD1000, DMMMAIN, DMM2, and SMPE0.

As usual, I appreciate your hard work and wish you happiness and
prosperity,

Dick

Note from Sam Golob:  As with Dick's other files, I have not deleted
                      the members which he said he deleted from his
                      own libraries.  I have merely pointed out which
                      members he did not think "worthy" of keeping.
                      Remember that Beethoven did not like all the
                      music he wrote, either.  Other people can judge
                      for themselves.....
